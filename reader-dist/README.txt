To view your digital yearbook, do the following:

-----------

For Windows users:
Run the program: Digital Express Digital Yearbook (Windows).jar

-----------

For Mac OS X users:
Run the bash script: Digital Express Digital Yearbook.sh

-----------

Troubleshooting:

Digital yearbooks require an updated version of Java. If experiencing
any problems, first update Java to the newest version (version 8 at
time of writing).

If the .sh file does not load your digital yearbook (on Mac OS X), open the
appropriate executable .jar file directly. The .jar files are named
with the operating system name followed by 32/64. All recently made
computers are likely 64 bit.

If you have attempted these solutions and are still having issues,
please contact the software producer.
